## About
Americano is a live HTML reporter for unit tests written with [MochaJS](https://mochajs.org/).

## Motivation
I noticed there was a hole in the Mocha ecosystem that has a few rickity bridges crossing it but nothing stable and reliable. Mocha lacks a stable, nicely packaged, easy to use, solution to HTML live reloading. Americano aims to provide a lightweight solution to this problem.

## Features
* Live Reload ðŸ¥³
* Generate HTML Reports
* No new API's to learn
